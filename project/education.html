                <h2>Brigham Young Univeristy Idaho</h2>
                <p>
                    Subsequent to my time at Snow College, I made the strategic decision to elevate my academic pursuits by transferring to Brigham Young University Idaho, where I embarked on the pursuit of a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Information Technology, specializing in the dynamic field of cybersecurity. This transition marked a significant chapter in my educational journey, as I delved into a more advanced and specialized curriculum designed to deepen my understanding of the intricate intersections between computer technology and cybersecurity.

                    During my tenure at Brigham Young University Idaho, the curriculum not only expanded my theoretical knowledge but also fostered a hands-on, experiential learning approach. This immersive educational environment provided me with the opportunity to acquire a diverse set of skills. Specifically, I honed my ability to script using bash and developed proficiency in programming using the versatile Python language. Beyond programming, my educational journey also encompassed an exploration of various operating systems, where I acquired the expertise to navigate, configure, and troubleshoot these systems adeptly.
                    
                    Furthermore, the curriculum exposed me to the intricacies of network setup and design, offering insights into the architecture and protocols that underpin effective network functionality. Classes dedicated to this field equipped me with the practical knowledge required to interact seamlessly with both Windows and Linux terminals. This not only broadened my technical skill set but also empowered me to efficiently accomplish necessary tasks through these terminal mediums, facilitating a comprehensive and hands-on approach to problem-solving in the dynamic realm of computer information technology.

                <h2>Snow College</h2>
                <p>
                    Following the successful completion of my high school education, I commenced my academic journey in higher education at Snow College in Utah. During this transformative period, I dedicated myself to the pursuit of knowledge in Computer Science, culminating in the achievement of my Associate of Science degree. This pivotal phase of my education was instrumental in providing me with a multifaceted skill set, encompassing proficiency in both procedural and object-oriented programming methodologies, with a specific emphasis on the versatile C# language.

                    The curriculum at Snow College was a rich tapestry of learning experiences, offering a deep dive into the intricacies of algorithmic structures and logic through procedural programming. Simultaneously, I gained a holistic understanding of software development principles, delving into the complexities of object-oriented programming. This educational endeavor not only enriched my technical prowess but also fostered a nuanced appreciation for the dynamic landscape of software development.
                    
                    Central to my academic pursuits was an immersive exploration of the C# programming languageâ€”a language renowned for its versatility and wide-ranging applications within the field of computer science. The skills honed in C# programming during my time at Snow College have proven to be invaluable, providing me with a solid foundation that continues to guide my academic and professional endeavors in the ever-evolving realm of computer science.
