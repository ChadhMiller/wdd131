                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hi there, I'm Chad Miller, currently enrolled at Brigham Young University Idaho, majoring in Computer Information Technology with a focus on cybersecurity. I'm genuinely passionate about staying on top of the fast-paced world of technology.

                    Driven by a keen interest in overcoming challenges and contributing to innovation, I aspire to make a mark in the tech industry. My motivation stems from a strong belief in helping others become their best selves. I enjoy continuous learning, always seeking to develop new skills that can benefit others.
                    
                    My goal isn't just personal success; it's about using technology to create solutions that empower individuals. I'm excited about the prospect of contributing to a better future, leveraging the transformative power of technology for positive change.

                <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                <p>
                    I've gained diverse work experiences that align with my major and career goals. As an IT Intern at Fidelis Cybersecurity, I focused on setting up infrastructure like network wiring and configurations for the team. Simultaneously, I worked as an IT Help Desk Technician during school, troubleshooting PC operating systems, and assisting with infrastructure tasks for faculty and students.

                    Later, as an OT Intern at Spectra, I expanded my skills by pulling and terminating wires, as well as programming and installing Verkada products for clients. These experiences deepened my technical understanding and showcased my ability to navigate real-world technology applications.
                    
                    Reflecting on my high school jobs, I learned the value of hard work and helping others succeed in their goals. These early experiences laid the foundation for my professional journey, emphasizing diligence and collaborative success.

                <h2>Education Background</h2>
                <p>
                    After attaining my high school diploma I start my higher education journey at Snow College in Utah. I got my Associate of Science in Computer Science. My major taught me the skills to program procedurally as well as learning to program object orientedly. These skills I learned was focused on the C# language. I Then transfered up to Brigham Young University Idaho to get my Bachelors of Science in Computer Information Technology with an emphasis in cybersecurity. While studying here I have also learned write bash scripts and program using python. I have also learned how to use various operating systems and setup and design a network. I have had classes that have taught me how to interact with windows and linux terminals to be able to accomplish the needed tasks done through that medium.
